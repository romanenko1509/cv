Front-end developer
===================

Nikita Romanenko
----------------

### 15.09.1999 (Kharkiv, Ukraine)

I have been developing Front-End for over 4 years. Behind more than a hundred successfully implemented projects, both in various companies and freelance. I quickly adapt to the tasks of the company, easily find a common language in the team, and am always ready to learn and develop as a specialist. I adequately estimate the tasks, time and resources required for their implementation, I can quickly navigate in case of difficulties, take the initiative in solving problems and improving the project.

Starting from scratch and dowstring support for IM on OpenCart. Robiv landings, corporate sites, expanding video hosting. Being a retailer on two great crypto exchanges, writing telegram robots on Node.JS, robots for processing great data from a database, writing admin panels for data robots. For the rest of my life, I dabbled in Shopify, working both in outsourcing and in food companies for the Western market.
