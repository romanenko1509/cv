### 15.09.1999 (Kharkiv, Ukraine)

I have been developing Front-End for over 3 years. Behind more than a hundred successfully implemented projects, both in various companies and freelance. I quickly adapt to the tasks of the company, easily find a common language in the team, and am always ready to learn and develop as a specialist. I adequately estimate the tasks, time and resources required for their implementation, I can quickly navigate in case of difficulties, take the initiative in solving problems and improving the project.

He was a developer at two large crypto exchanges, was engaged in writing Telegram bots on Node.JS, bots for processing large data from a database, writing admin panels for working with data.
